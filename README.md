4 DAYS SHARING CAMPING BADGET SAFARI TO TARANGIRE, NATIONAL SERENGETI NATIONAL, PARK NGORONGORO CRATER 

Day 1 Arusha – Tarangire National Park

In the morning you will start your safari with a drive to the Tarangire National Park with packed lunch. The park, roughly the size of Luxemburg, covers an area of approximately 2,600 km². The landscape of savannah, seasonal swamps and giant baobab trees is home to Masai giraffes, buffaloes, hartebeest, eland, fringe-eared oryx, the weird-looking long-necked gerenuk and over 550 species of birds. But it is the elephants, Tarangire is famous for and the park, where herds of up to 300 animals roam, is probably one of the best places in East Africa to see them and to get close to these giant creatures. After an extensive game drive, then drive to Kizumba Camp Site for dinner and overnight.

Day 2 Serengeti National Park

After breakfast drive to Serengeti National Park with packed lunch, while traveling through the Ngorongoro Conservation Area you might stop for a breath-taking view over the Ngorongoro Crater before continuing to the Serengeti National Park. Serengeti means “endless plains” in the language of the Maasai and you will see the grassland savannah stretching to the horizon. Bizarre rock formations called kopjes dot the grassy landscape where predators are often seen. Depending on the season you will witness the migration of thousands of animals for which this park is famous for. You will arrive at your campsite for dinner and overnight in the Seronera Valley in the central Serengeti in the late afternoon after a game drive through the central Serengeti.

Day 3 Serengeti National Park – Ngorongoro Conservation Area

After breakfast you join another game drive in the Serengeti National Park. This morning you might spot animals you haven’t seen yet. The Serengeti is also home to the Big Five – lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino and leopard – and today you might be able to see all the members of this group. After lunch at a picnic site, you will drive in direction of the Ngorongoro Crater. As soon as you have reached the edge of the crater, the caldera opens up before you. Over 25,000 animals live in this approximately 20 km wide crater. You will spend the night and dinner at a Simba Campsite directly on the crater’s edge with fantastic views over the caldera.

Day 4 Ngorongoro Crater – Arusha

Rise and shine! After breakfast at daybreak, you drive down into the crater with packed lunch. Inside the world’s largest caldera, you will see a diversity of wildlife ranging from black rhinos, Grant’s and Thomson’s gazelles, lions and leopards to elephants and mountain reedbucks in the forests on the slopes. You might also see buffaloes, spotted hyenas, rare wild dogs and some of the more than 500 bird species of the area. After an intensive game drive and a picnic lunch, you will leave the caldera in late afternoon then drive to Arusha.
